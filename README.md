Objective: create a world where users can find gifs of their favorite foods!

1. Create a web app that takes a topic (various foods in this case) and create buttons out of them.
2. Upon user clicking the button it will grab 10 static, non-animated gif impages from giphy API and place them on the web page.
3. When the user clicks on the still giphy image, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will become still.
4. Under every gif, it will display its rating (PG, G, so on).
5. A form will also exist on the page that allows users to input new items to add to the topics array (which will yield incremental buttons which have the same effect when clicked/unclicked)

* This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
